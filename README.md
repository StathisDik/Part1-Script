Query 1 
We want to focus on Breakfast cuisine in smaller cities of Greece.
For every city that exceeds the 1,000 orders we would like to compare "Breakfast" cuisine versus the
total efood, creating the metrics:
- Basket := Amount / Order
- Frequency := Orders / Users
- %Users that exceed 3 orders := (Users of Frequency >3) / Users
Order all your findings, showing us the 5 cities with the most Breakfast Orders and explain them in a
few words.

Query 2
What percentage of Orders do the top 10 users of each city contribute to their city?
